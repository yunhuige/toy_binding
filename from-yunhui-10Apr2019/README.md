Attached is the trajectory (first_1000.xtc), topology file (protein.gro) and a template file for superpose (new_test.pdb). 

I also fixed my scripts and did following plots. After treat pbc every point is within the region (-3.00859/2, 3.00859/2). But this is based on the trajectories from GROMACS pbc treatment. I cannot 100% trust these trajectories. So I still hope to see how will you do this using your own scripts rather than GROMACS. 

Thanks!
