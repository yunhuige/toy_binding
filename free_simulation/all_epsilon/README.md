# free simulation/all_epsilon README

We kept the original σ parameter (for carbon) the same (0.339967 nm), and varied the ε value from 0.0 to 10.0 kJ/mol in increments of 0.5 kJ/mol (the original value was 0.457730 kJ/mol).  For each value of epsilon, we simulated 10 trajectories of length 1 µs, resulting in a total of 210 µs of aggregate trajecory data.  Snapshots were recorded every 100 ps.
