set-up: input files for simulations (basic files for GROMACS, key plumed related files are not included) 

IMPORTANT: GROMACS version: 2016.3-plumed   
PLUMED version: 2.3.2  (both on CB2RR)

regular: regular well-tempered metadyanmics simulations. Aiming to get converged free energy landscape for further simulation. Also test effect of different parameters (sigma, pace, height) on thermodyanmic properties estimated from metaD simulations.

tiwary: well-tempered metadyanmics simulations (terminated when one unbinding event is observed). Trying to reproduce Tiwary method to estimate kinetics using metaD simulations (Tiwary, P., & Parrinello, M. (2013). From Metadynamics to Dynamics. Physical Review Letters, 111(23), 230602â€“5. http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.230602)
